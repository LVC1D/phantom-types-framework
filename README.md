# Phantom Types Framework

## Goal
Master zero-cost abstractions using phantom types and type-state patterns.

## Learning Objectives
- PhantomData and marker types
- Compile-time state machines
- Type-safe builder pattern
- Zero-cost abstractions verification

## Implementation Plan
1. Basic phantom type examples
2. Type-state file handle (Open/Closed states)
3. Type-safe builder pattern with compile-time validation

## Status
🔄 In Progress - Week 4, Day 3
